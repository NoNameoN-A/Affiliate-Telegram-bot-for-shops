## YOUR_DB_PATH
If you want to send automatically some messages on your channel you must have a Database where your bot can go to get message's information to send.
If you didn't use a DB don't worry you can use [DB Browser for SQLite](https://sqlitebrowser.org/), which is extremely user-friendly.
When you have downloaded your preferred SW create a database and copy your database path into the python program.
## your_db_table
Open your database with your preferred SW and create a Table. If you never sen a database table you can think that you have a Database where you can have a lot of sections, so you have a section that it is a specific part of your database, as your info for the messages.
In the table, you must create some sub-sections where you will insert your affiliate information, so your data.

 - DatabaseName *Your Database*
